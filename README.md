# Basic Weibull Analysis

## About this project
In this project I try to implement a few simple tools for some basic Weibull
analysis. At the center of it all are estimation methods for quantiles of
the Weibull distribution function. These will be used to estimate the parameters
of the two-parameter Weibull distribution function. The functionalities shall be
combined in a ShinyApp. Functionalities will include:
  - Choosing example data sets
  - reading in own data
  - choosing estimation methods for quantiles
  - visualization of a Weibull-paper plot
  - output of linear model to estimate parameters
  - plotting of Weibull distribution, density and failure rate

For a more detailed documentation please refere to the PDFs in the documentation
directory.
You are welcome to try the app using your own data but I can not guarantee the
accuracy of the results (at least for now). Testing is done by hand at the
moment but I plan to implement a testing suite in the future.

Any kind of feedback is highly appreciated!
