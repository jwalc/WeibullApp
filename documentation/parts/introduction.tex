\section{Introduction}

This project revolves around the Weibull distribution
$$ F(t) = 1 - \exp\left(- \left( \frac{t - t_0}{T}\right)^b\right), $$
where $t_0 = 0$. The Weibull distribution is used in reliability and survival analysis for answering the question: "How likely is a unit to survive until a certain point in time?"\ We aim at calculating the parameters $b$ and $T$ using data. With data from experiments 
we can estimate the underlying quantiles of the Weibull distribution using different methods.\\
We will mainly use data from reliability tests, where we measure the time of failure for a number of units. The data comes in two forms: right-censored and uncensored data. This basically means that either all units have failed during the test and we know all of their times to failure (uncensored), or we have some survivors that lasted for the time of the experiment (right-censored). The methods differ on what data they use to estimate the quantiles of the underlying distribution. Some only use information about failed units, some will incorporate the information about survivors.\\
The estimated quantiles are then used to estimate the parameters $b$ and $T$. Using a proper transformation we can calculate these using a linear regression (see "Methods" for more details).
