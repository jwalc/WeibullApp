\section{Methods}
In general the data has to be sorted by increasing time of failure.

\subsection{Median Rank Regression}
The Median Rank method (MR) uses uncensored data. Hence it is not able to incorporate information about survivors. 
We use sorting of the data to assign ranks $i$ in an ascending order. The size of the sample is denoted by $n$. The estimator is then given by
$$ F_i = \frac{i - 0.3}{n + 0.4}.$$
