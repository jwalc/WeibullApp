\section{Methods}
In general the data has to be sorted by increasing time of failure.

\subsection{Median Rank Regression}
The Median Rank method uses uncensored data. Hence it is not able to incorporate information about survivors. 
We use sorting of the data to assign ranks $i$ in an ascending order. The size of the sample is denoted by $n$. The estimator is then given by
$$ F_i = \frac{i - 0.3}{n + 0.4}.$$

\subsection{Sudden Death Method}

\subsection{Kaplan-Meier Method}

\subsection{Nelson Method}
The Nelson Method can be used on right-censored data. We first assign an inverse Ranking $r_i$ for all of the samples in our data. Then, we compute the failure rate by $\lambda_{\text{Nel}, i}(t) = \frac{1}{r_i}$ for all failed units. The cumulative failure rate is given by $H_{\text{Nel}, i}(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{i} \lambda_{\text{Nel}, i}$. Finally we use the estimator
$$ F_i(t) = 1 - e^{-H_{\text{Nel}, i}(t)}. $$
Due to an strictly monotonously increasing $\lambda_{\text{Nel}}$, this method is only suitable for Weibull distributions with $b>0$. (For a derivation of $\lambda_{\text{Nel}}$ please check other sources.)
